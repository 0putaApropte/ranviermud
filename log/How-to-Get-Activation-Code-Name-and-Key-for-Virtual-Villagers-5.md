## Virtual Villagers 5: New Believers Tips and Tricks
 
Virtual Villagers 5: New Believers is a challenging game that requires you to manage a tribe of villagers on a mysterious island. You have to deal with hostile natives, scarce resources, and various puzzles. To help you succeed in this game, here are some tips and tricks that you can use:

- Adjust the game speed to fast mode. This will make the time on the island go faster, which means your villagers will grow, learn, and work faster. You can also change the time on your computer by 1-2 hours to speed up the game, but don't do it more than that or your villagers might die of starvation.
- Select your starting villagers wisely. You should have at least one male and one female of breeding age (18-50), one child (under 14), and one villager with each of the six skills: farming, building, research, healing, parenting, and devotion. You can check their skills, likes, and dislikes by clicking on them.
- Destroy the totems as soon as possible. The totems are blocking your access to important areas of the island, such as the lab, the food bin, the clothing hut, and the mausoleum. To destroy them, you need to use your god powers (lightning, bees, butterflies) to distract or convert the heathens guarding them, then drop your villagers on them.
- Convert the heathens to your side. The heathens are the natives who don't believe in you and will try to stop your progress. You can convert them by using your god powers or by having your villagers interact with them. There are four types of heathens: orange-masked (curious), red-masked (angry), blue-masked (mystic), and purple-masked (the leader). Each type requires a different strategy to convert.
- Keep an eye on your food supply. Food is essential for your villagers' survival and happiness. You can get food from mushrooms, fish, crops, and fruit trees. You should always have at least one farmer working on the crops and one child picking mushrooms. You can also upgrade your farming skill to unlock new sources of food.
- Solve the puzzles. There are 16 puzzles in the game that will unlock new features and secrets. You can check your progress on the puzzles tab. Some puzzles require certain skills, technologies, or events to be completed. You can find hints for each puzzle in the game or online.

Virtual Villagers 5: New Believers is a fun and addictive game that will keep you entertained for hours. With these tips and tricks, you can make your tribe thrive and discover all the mysteries of the island.
