Inventor Professional 2019 supports only 64-bit operating systems and cannot be installed on 32-bit systems. It requires a minimum of 8 GB RAM, 40 GB disk space, and 1 GB GPU with DirectX 11 compliance[^4^]. It also requires a full local install of Microsoft Excel 2010, 2013 or 2016 for some features[^4^].
 
Inventor Professional 2019 offers many benefits for users, such as:
 
- Improving product performance with powerful 3D modeling and simulation capabilities.
- Reducing repetitive tasks with customizable configurations and automation tools.
- Boosting collaboration with cloud-based design review and data exchange.
- Participating in BIM projects with interoperability and metadata authoring.

Inventor Professional 2019 can be purchased as a subscription from Autodesk's official website[^3^]. The subscription options include monthly, annual, or three-year plans. Users can also download a free trial version for 30 days to test the software before buying[^5^].
 
Inventor Professional 2019 is a powerful and versatile software that can help users create ambitious and innovative mechanical designs. It is one of the best solutions for product development and engineering in the market.
  
Inventor Professional 2019 has many features that can help users create complex and realistic models. Some of the features include:

- Sheet metal design: Users can create sheet metal parts with parametric features, flanges, bends, punches, and cuts. They can also convert solid models to sheet metal parts and export them to DXF or DWG formats.
- Frame design: Users can create structural frames with standard or custom profiles and apply welds, end treatments, and notches. They can also generate cut lists and drawings for fabrication.
- Tube and pipe design: Users can create rigid and flexible tube and pipe runs with fittings, valves, supports, and hangers. They can also route tubes and pipes along existing geometry or sketch paths.
- Cable and harness design: Users can create electrical cable and harness assemblies with wires, connectors, terminals, clips, and bundles. They can also generate wire lists, nailboard drawings, and reports.

Inventor Professional 2019 also has advanced simulation tools that can help users optimize their designs and validate their performance. Some of the simulation tools include:

- Stress analysis: Users can perform linear static and modal analysis on parts and assemblies to evaluate stress, strain, displacement, and natural frequencies. They can also apply loads, constraints, contacts, and materials to their models.
- Dynamic simulation: Users can simulate the motion of parts and assemblies with joints, springs, dampers, motors, and forces. They can also analyze velocity, acceleration, energy, and power of their models.
- Mold design: Users can create plastic injection mold designs with core and cavity extraction, mold base selection, runner design, cooling system design, and mold opening analysis. They can also check for interferences, draft angles, undercuts, and wall thicknesses.
