- Tanner S-Edit: A schematic capture and netlist generation tool that supports hierarchical design and mixed-signal simulation.
- Tanner T-Spice: A SPICE simulator that integrates with Tanner S-Edit and supports advanced analysis features such as Monte Carlo, parametric sweeps, and noise analysis.
- Tanner L-Edit: A layout editor that supports full-custom and standard-cell design methodologies, as well as DRC, LVS, and extraction capabilities.
- Tanner W-Edit: A waveform viewer that displays simulation results from Tanner T-Spice and other simulators.
- Tanner Designer: An analog verification management tool that tracks all simulations for a project and displays results in a dashboard.

Tanner Tools v14.1 is compatible with Windows 64-bit operating systems and can be downloaded from the CMC Microsystems website[^1^]. Tanner Tools v14.1 offers many benefits for analog and mixed-signal designers, such as:

- A user-friendly interface that simplifies the design flow and reduces the learning curve.
- A seamless integration of schematic capture, simulation, layout, and verification tools that enables faster design iterations and shorter time-to-market.
- A comprehensive library of device models, symbols, and PDKs that supports a wide range of technologies and foundries.
- A high-performance SPICE simulator that delivers accurate and reliable results for complex circuits.
- A flexible layout editor that supports both manual and automated layout techniques and ensures design quality and manufacturability.
- An analog verification management tool that automates the verification process and ensures design compliance with specifications.

Tanner Tools v14.1 is a powerful design suite for analog and mixed-signal circuits that can help designers achieve their design goals with efficiency and confidence.

One of the key features of Tanner Tools v14.1 is the integration of schematic capture and simulation tools. Tanner S-Edit and Tanner T-Spice work together to provide a smooth and efficient design flow for analog and mixed-signal circuits. Designers can create and edit schematics in Tanner S-Edit, which supports hierarchical design and mixed-signal simulation. Tanner S-Edit also generates netlists that can be used by Tanner T-Spice or other simulators. Tanner T-Spice is a SPICE simulator that integrates with Tanner S-Edit and supports advanced analysis features such as Monte Carlo, parametric sweeps, and noise analysis. Tanner T-Spice also provides accurate device models and PDKs for various technologies and foundries. Designers can run simulations in Tanner T-Spice and view the results in Tanner W-Edit, a waveform viewer that displays simulation results from Tanner T-Spice and other simulators. Tanner W-Edit also supports measurement and annotation functions that help designers analyze and debug their circuits.
 
Another key feature of Tanner Tools v14.1 is the integration of layout and verification tools. Tanner L-Edit and Tanner Designer work together to provide a complete solution for laying out and verifying analog and mixed-signal circuits. Designers can create and edit layouts in Tanner L-Edit, which supports full-custom and standard-cell design methodologies, as well as DRC, LVS, and extraction capabilities. Tanner L-Edit also supports cross-probing with Tanner S-Edit and Tanner T-Spice, which enables designers to easily switch between schematic and layout views and check the consistency of their designs. Tanner Designer is an analog verification management tool that tracks all simulations for a project and displays results in a dashboard. Tanner Designer also supports specification-driven verification, which allows designers to define specifications for their circuits and automatically run simulations to check if they are met. Tanner Designer also generates reports that document the verification status and results for each circuit block.
